## The Bots

|                                                         Sigma                                                         |                                            Iota                                            |

| Server management, administration, moderation, stat tracking, and others intended to help you better run your server. | Looking for something a bit more fun? Mini-games, music, matchmaking, greetings, and more! |

You can invite one or more of these bots as well as configure their settings through the [vxBots Dashboard](http://discord.vevox.io).

### Contributions
We could always use your help localizing or documenting features of both the Dashboard and the bots themselves. Get a feel for the style by reading through the existing files then feel free to [submit a pull request](/pulls) and add to the lot.

If you have a suggestion or found a bug, please [open an issue](/issues). You can track our progress with features or bugs both through the issues page itself, [milestones](/milestones), and/or on our [project page](/projects).

### Legal
*By using our bots, you agree to our Terms of Use, including, but not limited to, agreeing that neither Vevox Digital, nor any of the contributors to this project, are responsible for damage caused by unintended use of, unexpected behavior by, or misconfiguration of any of the "bots" or the "dashboard".*
